# Devbox Installation

To install Devbox, follow the instructions on the [official Devbox installation page](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing-devbox).

After installing Devbox, you can set up the development environment for Star Commander by running:

```bash
devbox shell
```

This command will create and enter a development environment with all the necessary dependencies installed. If it's your first time using Devbox, it may take a while to set up the environment.
